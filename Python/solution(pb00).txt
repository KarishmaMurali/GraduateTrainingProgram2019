1.
Write a program that examines three variables—x, y, and z— and prints the largest odd number among them. 
If none of them are odd, it should print a message to that effect.

x=int(input("Enter 1st number"))
y=int(input("Enter 2nd number"))
z=int(input("Enter 3rd number"))
list1=[]
if x%2!=0:
    list1.append(x)
if y%2!=0:
    list1.append(y)
if z%2!=0:
    list1.append(z)
largest=0
for i in list1:
    if i>largest:
        largest=i
if largest>0:
    print(largest)
else:
    print("not an odd number")


output:
------
Enter 1st number2
Enter 2nd number4
Enter 3rd number6
not an odd number

Enter 1st number 2
Enter 2nd number 5
Enter 3rd number 3
5

def right_justify(s):
    print("%70s" %s)

right_justify('cigna')


output:
------

3.
#Write a program that asks the user to input 10 integers, and then prints the largest odd number that was entered.
# If no odd number was entered, it should print a message to that effect.

numlist=[]
largest=0
n = int(input("Enter number of elements"))
# take list as input from user and put it in an empty list
for i in range(0,n):
    element=int(input())
    numlist.append(element)

# to traverse through the list and find the largest among them
for j in numlist:
    if j%2!=0 and j>largest:  # give largest as 0 initially
        largest=j              # if j is odd and largest when traversed using for loop - j will be largest
if largest==0 :  #if thr is no odd number then largest will be 0 only - which makes it a list of even numbers - so print no odd numbers - else just print the largest
        print("there were no odd numbers")
else:
    print(largest)


OUTPUT:
-------

#Let s be a string that contains a sequence of decimal numbers separated by commas, e.g., s = '1.23,2.4,3.123'.
# Write a program that prints the sum of the numbers in s.

str1=input("enter a string of numbers separated by comas")
nums=[float(i) for i in str1.split(",")] # creates a list of floats spilt by ,
print(sum(nums)) # sum() finds the sum of the elements in the list


OUTPUT:
-------
